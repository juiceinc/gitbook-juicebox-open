  The Share section of the editing panel is where you decide how to share your
  app with others.

# Share

Until your app is shared, only editors in your workspace will see the changes you've made. When you're ready for others to see your app, it's time to share your work with viewers. There are two steps to sharing an app:

1. Publish the app (or changes to the app)
2. Invite viewers

&#x20;The following pages describe these steps:

{% content-ref url="publishing-app-changes.md" %}
[publishing-app-changes.md](publishing-app-changes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="sharing-and-access-controls.md" %}
[sharing-and-access-controls.md](sharing-and-access-controls.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
