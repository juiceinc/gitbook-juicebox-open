# Slices

Slices are the basic building blocks of your story. Slices are added to [sections](../sections.md), and each slice can have text and/or a [chart](../charts/). 

## Adding and deleting slices

To add a slice to an empty section, select the **+ Add Slice** button.

To add a slice to a section that has one or more slices, click the **+** where you want the new slice to appear.

Rather than adding a brand new slice, it may be easier to duplicate and modify an existing slice. To duplicate a slice, select the menu icon \(![](../../../.gitbook/assets/ellipsis-h-solid.svg)\) in the slice you want to duplicate and select **Duplicate** from the dropdown. The new duplicate slice will appear directly below the original slice.

To delete a slice, select the menu icon \(![](../../../.gitbook/assets/ellipsis-h-solid.svg)\) in the slice you want to delete and select **Delete** from the dropdown.

## Slice content

Slices can contain text only, a chart or image only, or a combination of text and  a chart, or text and an image.

### Adding text

To add text to a slice, simply type in the text area. Use the text editor to style text and add emojis and links.

### Adding a chart

To add a chart to a slice, select the **Add Chart** button and select the desired [chart](../charts/) from the list.

Charts show sample data until you choose what data your chart will show. This lets you explore what kind of story you want to tell even though you may not be sure what data you need.

You can interact with a chart while it is showing sample data.

### Adding an image

To add an image to a slice, select the **Add Image** button and either upload your own image or find an image on Unsplash.

## Reordering slices

To reorder slices, drag and drop the slice where you want it to display. You can reorder slices within a section and move slices to different sections.

## Slice layouts

There are four layout options for slices that control how slice text will appear in relation to the chart or image. To adjust the layout, hover over the slice, click the layout icon, and select the desired layout option.

| Icon | Layout option | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-up-solid.svg)  | Text above | The slice text will display above the chart or image. This is the default layout |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-left-solid.svg) | Text on left | The slice text will display to the left of the chart or image. |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-right-solid%20%281%29.svg)  | Text on right | The slice text will display to the right of the chart or image. |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-down-solid.svg)  | Text below | The slice text will display below the chart or image.  |

{% hint style="info" %}
For text-only slices, changing the layout will have no effect. 
{% endhint %}

## Slice backgrounds

By default, slices have a transparent background. To adjust the background color, hover over the slice, click the paint drop icon, and select the desired color from the color picker. If you have a specific color in mind, you can enter the hex code for that color.
