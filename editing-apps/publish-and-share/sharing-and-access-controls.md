# Sharing and access controls

After you publish your app, it's time to invite others to view it! How you do this depends on whether you published the app as a public app or a private app.

## Sharing a public app

To share a public app, click the Copy Public Link button to copy the app link and share the link as you would any other website link. Anyone who clicks on the link will see the published version of your app and be counted as a page view.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also embed your public app into another website by putting the app link into an iframe on that website. 
{% endhint %}

## Sharing a private app

To share a private app, you share an access link.

### Access links

To share your app, 

* navigate to the Publish & Share section of the editing panel
* copy the the access link
* share the link with anyone you want to view your app

The access link can be sent via email, text, social media, or any other means. The link can be used by multiple people and will remain live until you [regenerate the link](sharing-and-access-controls.md#regenerate-link).  When a person clicks on the link, they will be asked to [sign in](../../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to your Juicebox workspace to see the app.

### Access controls

#### Regenerate link

To prevent new users from accessing the app through a previously shared access link, simply regenerate the link. Any previous links will no longer allow new users to sign up. Users that signed up using previous links will still be able to see the app. Their access can be managed through the user management portal. 

To regenerate the link, select **Link Settings** and then **Regenerate**.

#### User email domain \(future release\)

In a future release, access links will be able to limit access to only users with specific email domains. 

## Switching between public and private 

To change a public app to a private app, or vice versa, simply select the corresponding button.
