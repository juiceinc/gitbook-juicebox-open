# Publishing a report (or report changes)

The first step in sharing a report is publishing the report.&#x20;

## Publishing for the first time

To publish for the first time, click the Sharing button in the report header. It will say "**Start Sharing**".

Next, decide how you want to control access to the report:

* **Sign in required**. Report can only be viewed by those that have signed in with a Juicebox account that has access to the report. Viewer access to the report can be [managed on the People page](../../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md) by workspace owners or admins.
* **Link with a password**. Report can be viewed by anyone with the report link and password. Because sign in is not required, report access cannot be managed.
* **Anyone with the link**. Report can be viewed by anyone with the report link. Because sign in is not required, report access cannot be managed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If your report contains information that not everyone should see, you should publish it as **Sign in required**. If your report does not contain sensitive information, you may not know how you want to control access to the report. That's ok! Just select one and change it later as needed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After publishing, you are ready to [invite viewers to your report](sharing-and-access-controls.md).&#x20;

## Publishing changes to a report

Until you publish them, any changes you make to a report are only visible to editors while in the draft report. That is, viewers with access to the report won't see your changes until you publish them. With Juicebox, you can publish, refine your report, publish the new changes, refine some more, publish the new changes, and so on. You can continually improve and experiment without affecting what viewers see until you're ready.

To publish changes, click the Sharing button in the report header. It will say "**Sharing**". Then click **Save & Publish**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Edit freely** - you can always [discard changes](publishing-app-changes.md#discard-changes-to-an-app), to return to the last version of the report that you shared with viewers.
{% endhint %}

The version of the report that editors work on is called the **draft report**. All changes are saved to the draft report until they are published, you do not have to keep track of whether you are working in the draft report. Here are indicators that you are in the draft version:

* You see "draft" in the report url
* You see the editing panel
* You see the Sharing button

## Discarding changes to a report

At some point you may want to discard all the unpublished changes in the draft report and go back to the previously published version of the report. To do this, click the Sharing button and select **Discard**.

Discarding changes will discard **all changes** made since the last publish _**including changes to data**_**.**&#x20;
