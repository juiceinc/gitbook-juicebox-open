# Getting a Workspace

## Get a workspace

To get a workspace, go to [juiceanalytics.com](https://www.juiceanalytics.com) and click the **Let's Talk** button. From there, pick a time to talk or send us a message. Once we understand your needs, we'll send you instructions to create your workspace.&#x20;

## Your new workspace

After creating your workspace, you'll be taken to the workspace [home page](new-workspace.md#the-workspace-home-page). You are the [owner](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#owner) of this workspace.&#x20;

Your workspace will have its own web address (something like 782-wily-persimmons.myjuicebox.io, which may be customized, depending on your subscription plan). This is your workspace URL. You can go directly to this URL to access your workspace.

### The workspace home page

After [signing in](../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to your workspace, you will be on the workspace home page. What you see on the home page will depend on your [user role](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md):

* Viewers will only see those reports they have been given access to.&#x20;
* Editors, admins, and owners for the workspace will see all reports in the workspace. &#x20;
* Owners and admins will have access to the [People page](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users) to manage users.
* Owners will have access to the workspace [Settings](../managing-workspaces/workspace-settings.md) and [Subscriptions](../managing-workspaces/subscription-and-billing.md) pages.&#x20;

To find a specific report you can use the **Sort by** feature to order reports by last edit date, last publish date, or alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** feature to search report titles and descriptions.&#x20;

To open the draft version of a report, click the **Edit** button. To open the published version of a report, click the **View** button.  &#x20;
