# Loading data

There are two steps to adding a data source: 

1. upload or connect to your data
2. add your data ingredients

This section covers the first step. \(The second step is covered [here](adding-ingredients/).\) You can upload a CSV or, in a future release, connect to a database table or view or a Google Sheet.

## Upload a CSV

To upload a CSV, click **Connect & Upload Data Sources**, select **CSV**, and then select the CSV file to be uploaded. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using CSVs, it is important that your data be nice and clean. Common problem areas include missing data ****and text values in numeric columns. Here are some tips for [preparing your data](../design-tips/preparing-your-data.md). 
{% endhint %}

### The data preview

After the data loads, the **data preview** will pop up, providing a preview of your data. The preview will only show a sample of your data records.

{% hint style="success" %}
After loading your data, do a quick review of the data preview for anything unexpected. If you spot something unexpected, this usually indicates an issue with the data. Here are some common examples:

* Do any numeric fields have a`string`data type? That likely means you have non-numeric data in the column \(e.g., spaces, commas, "N/A", "null", "-"\). Any field you plan to use in a sum or average calculation must have the`number`data type. 
* Do any date fields have a`string`data type? That likely means you have non-date data in the column. Any date fields you want to use in a [trend](../story-designer/charts/trend.md) chart must have the`date`data type. 
* Does a field name have unexpected underscores \(e.g., `_column_name_`, rather than `column_name`\)? That likely means there are leading or trailing spaces in your column headings.

Spotting and fixing these issues early and re-loading your data will save you time and frustration down the road. 
{% endhint %}

To exit the data preview, simply click outside of the data preview window. To return to the data preview, select the the data source button from the list of data sources.

## Connect to Sample Data

Juicebox also provides a selection of sample data tables if you want to start exploring before you have your own data. You can start by selecting **Connect & Upload Data Sources** then **Sample Data**.

![Choosing the Sample Data connection](../../.gitbook/assets/sample-data%20%281%29.jpg)

Choose a table to get started and select **Add Table**.

## Connect to a database table

If your app is connected to a database, you can select the schema and table to use in the data source. If you are interested in connecting your app to a database, please reach out to us by clicking the chat button below. The following databases are supported:

* Redshift
* Snowflake
* Postgres
* SQL Server
* MySQL

## Connect to a Google Sheet \(future release\)

## Next step: Adding ingredients

After loading your data, the next step is [adding ingredients](adding-ingredients/).
