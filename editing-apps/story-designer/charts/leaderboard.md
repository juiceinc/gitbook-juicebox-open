# Leaderboard

The leaderboard chart displays which dimensions rank at the top (or bottom) across multiple measures. Adding a slice with a leaderboard chart (i.e., a leaderboard slice) is a good choice when users want to quickly see the "winners" and "losers."

## Adding a leaderboard slice

To add a leaderboard slice:

* select **Leaderboard** from the chart list

![Select Leaderboard from dropdown](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (369).png>)

* select the column with the values you want to be ranked
* select the measures by which you want to rank the column values
* select the max rows
* add slice text (optional)

## Using a leaderboard slice

If you have 10 rows in your leaderboard, you can use the **LOOK AT** options to see the top 10, bottom 10, or top 5 and bottom 5. (If you have 25 rows, you can opt to see the top 25, bottom 25, or top 13 and bottom 12). To see the ranking of a column value not shown in the leaderboard, you can click the filter pill and search for the dimension. Selections made in the leaderboard slice will filter downstream slices.&#x20;
