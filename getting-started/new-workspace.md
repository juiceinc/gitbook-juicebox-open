## Your new workspace

After creating your workspace, you'll be taken to the workspace [home page](new-workspace.md#the-workspace-home-page). You are the [owner](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#owner) of this workspace.&#x20;

Your workspace will have its own web address. This is your workspace URL. You can go directly to this URL to access your workspace. But if you forget the URL, you can always go to [myjuicebox.io](https://myjuicebox.io) and click **Sign back in** to access the workspaces associated with your email address.&#x20;

### The workspace home page

After signing in to your workspace, you will be on the workspace home page. What you see on the home page will depend on your [user role](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md):

* Viewers will only see those reports they have been given access to.&#x20;
* Editors, admins, and owners for the workspace will see all reports in the workspace. &#x20;
* Owners and admins will have access to the [People page](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users) to manage users.
* Owners will have access to the workspace [Settings](../managing-workspaces/workspace-settings.md) and [Subscriptions](../managing-workspaces/subscription-and-billing.md) pages.&#x20;

To find a specific report you can use the **Sort by** feature to order reports by last edit date, last publish date, or alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** feature to search report titles and descriptions.&#x20;

To open the draft version of a report, click the **Edit** button. To open the shared version of a report, hover or click around the report title, and then click the **Open Report** button. (If the report has not been shared, you'll see a "Not shared yet" message. &#x20;
