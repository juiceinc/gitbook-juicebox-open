# What is Juicebox?

**Juicebox** is a platform that lets you easily create and share beautiful, interactive data visualization reports. No code required.

A Juicebox **report** is the solution you create with Juicebox. [Click here](https://gallery.myjuicebox.io/join/juicebox-gallery) to join the Juicebox Gallery workspace to see example reports. Each report has its own URL, and you manage who can view it or make changes to it.

## Parts of a Juicebox report

So what makes up a Juicebox report? Each report has the following parts that flow in a hierarchy:

* A **story** (or data story) is a set of charts (i.e., data visualizations), text, and media presented on a single page, similar to a data dashboard. Each story should be focused on a particular audience and purpose, and guide users to the actionable insights they need. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. (Support for multiple stories per app is planned for a future release.)
* Each [**section**](../editing-apps/story-designer/#sections) is composed of one or more slices. Sections allow you to control layouts and background colors within the story.
* [**Slices**](../building-reports/story-designer/slices/) are the basic building blocks of your story. Each slice can have text and/or an image, video, or chart.

## What's unique about Juicebox

Juicebox lets you easily present and communicate your data to non-technical audiences. Key elements of Juicebox include:

* **No code required**. You can build a Juicebox report entirely from your computer browser using the [editing panel](../building-reports/creating-and-editing.md#edit-an-app). If you know how to create pivot tables and formulas in a spreadsheet, you are ready to start building reports.&#x20;
* **Interactivity is automatic**. Selections made in slices above flow down to the slices below by default, allowing users to drill down and drive the story where they want to go.&#x20;
* **Sharing is the point**. Juicebox report are meant to be [shared](../building-reports/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md) easily. You can decide how to share it (publicly or to only signed-in users). For reports that require a user to sign in, you can set up user data permissions so that each user only sees what they are supposed to see. The reports look great whether shared on a desktop, tablet, or phone.&#x20;
* **Best practices are built in**. We have done a lot of thinking about best practices for communicating with data. (Check out our [book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Fluency-Empowering-Organization-Communication/dp/1118851013) and [blog](https://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/).) These best practices are already built into the platform, so you don't have to worry about it.&#x20;
