# Scatterplot

The scatterplot chart displays a column value as a bubble plotted at the intersection of the x-axis measure and the y-axis measure. Adding a slice with a scatterplot chart (i.e., a scatterplot slice) is a good choice when users want to see the relationship between two measures. &#x20;

## Adding a scatterplot slice

To add a scatterplot slice:

* select **Scatterplot** from the chart list

![Select Scatterplot from the dropdown](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (480).png>)

* select the column with the values you want to display as bubbles
* select the x- and y-axis measures
* select the measure to use for the bubble size (optional)
* select the number of regions
* add slice text (optional)

## Using a scatterplot slice

Selections made in the scatterplot slice will filter downstream slices. You can select individual bubbles or regions. Selecting a region will select all bubbles within the region.&#x20;
