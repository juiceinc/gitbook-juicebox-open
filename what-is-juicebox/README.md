# What is Juicebox?

**Juicebox** is a platform that lets you easily create and share beautiful, interactive data visualization apps. No code required!

A Juicebox **report** is the solution you create with Juicebox. [Here's an example of a Juicebox report](https://explore.myjuicebox.io/a/movie\_trends2/movie\_trends). Each report has its own URL, and you manage who can view it or make changes to it.

## Parts of a Juicebox report

So what makes up a Juicebox report? Each report has the following parts that flow in a hierarchy:

* A [**story**](../editing-apps/story-designer/#what-is-a-story) (or data story) is a set of charts (i.e., data visualizations) presented on a single page, similar to a data dashboard. Each story should be focused on a particular audience and purpose, and guide users to the actionable insights they need. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. (Support for multiple stories per app is planned for a future release.)
* Each [**section**](../editing-apps/story-designer/sections.md) is composed of one or more slices. Sections allow you to control layouts and background colors within the story.
* [**Slices**](../editing-apps/story-designer/slices/) are the basic building blocks of your story. Each slice can have text and/or an image or chart.

## What's unique about Juicebox

Juicebox lets you make data presentations easily and automatically. Key elements of Juicebox include:

* **No code required**. You can build a Juicebox report entirely from your computer browser using the [editing panel](../editing-apps/creating-and-editing.md#edit-an-app). If you know how to create pivot tables and formulas in a spreadsheet, you are ready to start building reports.&#x20;
* **Interactivity is automatic**. Selections made in slices above _automatically_ flow down to the slices below, allowing users to drill down and drive the story where they want to go. We call this [zoom and filter](../viewing-apps/data-flow.md).
* **Sharing is the point**. Juicebox report are meant to be [shared](../editing-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md)â€”easily and widely.
