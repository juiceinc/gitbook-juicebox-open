# Story Designer

A story is a set of charts \(i.e., data visualizations\) presented on a single page, similar to a data dashboard. A story should be tightly focused on a particular audience and purpose and gently guide users to the actionable insights they need. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. Each slice can have text and/or charts.

The Story Designer section of the editing panel is where you design your story. To access the Story Designer section, select the **Designer** button at the top of the editing panel.

* Story Settings
* Sections
* Slices
* Charts

These components are described on the following pages:
