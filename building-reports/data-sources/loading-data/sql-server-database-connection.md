# SQL Server database connection

To set up a connection to a SQL Server database, you'll need to provide us the following information:

1. **Hostname or IP Address**. This identifies the location of the SQL Server instance. It could be athe hostname of the server (e.g., `myserver.example.com`) or the server's IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
2. **Port**. The port number that SQL Server is listening on. The default port is usually `1433`.
3. **Database Name**. The name of the specific database you want to connect to.
4. **Username**. The username of a SQL Server user account with permission to access the database.
5. **Password**. The password associated with the specified username.

**Where to find this information:**

Check the SQL Server configuration, use SQL Server Management Studio to view server properties, or consult your database administrator.

Once we have this information, we can use it to connect to your SQL Server database to your Juicebox workspace.
