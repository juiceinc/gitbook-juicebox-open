# Adding App Users

Inviting new users to a private app is done by [sharing the app access link](../editing-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md#access-links).  Anyone who clicks on the access link and [signs in](../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) becomes a new user in your workspace with the [viewer user role](user-management-and-roles.md#viewer).  

{% hint style="info" %}
For public apps, [anyone with the app link can view the app ](../editing-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md#sharing-a-public-app)\(no sign in required\). 
{% endhint %}
