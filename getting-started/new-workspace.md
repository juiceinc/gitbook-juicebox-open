## Your new workspace

After creating your workspace, you'll be taken to the workspace [**apps page**](new-workspace.md#the-apps-page). You are the [owner](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#owner) of this workspace.

Your workspace will have its own web address. This is your workspace URL. You can go directly to this URL to access your workspace. But if you forget the URL, you can always go to [myjuicebox.io](https://myjuicebox.io) and click **Sign back in** to access the workspaces associated with your email address. 

### The apps page

After signing in to your workspace, you will be on the workspace apps page. The apps page is like the home page for your workspace. What you see on the apps page will depend on your [user role](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md). Editors for the workspace will see all of the workspace apps on the apps page. Viewers will only see those apps they have been given access to. Owners and admins will see all workspace apps and have access to the [People view](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users) to manage users.

To find a specific app you can use the **Sort by** feature to order apps by last edit date, last publish date, or alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** feature to search app titles and descriptions. 

To open the draft version of an app, click the **Edit** button. To open the published version of an app, hover or click around the app title, and then click the **Open Published** button. \(If the app has not been published, you'll see a "Not published yet" message.
