# Header Style

The Header Style section at the top of the Design tab is where you can quickly create and style an intro section for your report.&#x20;

To do this, first expand the  Header Style section. Select the header style, background color, and background image you want to apply, and then click **Save**.&#x20;

## Background Colors

You can adjust the background color of the header style. To do this, click the paint drop <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tint-solid (1).svg" alt="" data-size="line"> in the upper right of the Header Style section and choose a different color from the color theme, customize the color theme, or add a custom background color that is outside of the color theme.&#x20;

### Choose another theme color

To change the header background color from one theme color to another, you simply select the new theme color.&#x20;

### Customize the color theme

You can customize the color associated with one or more theme colors by clicking the **Customize** button and modifying the theme colors as desired. Any other section or slice using the modified theme colors will change to the new colors.

### Add a custom background color

You can add a color outside of the color theme by clicking the **Custom** button and selecting a custom color. The custom color will apply only to the header and will not update with any color theme changes.&#x20;

## Background Images

You can add a background image to your header by either uploading your own image or by selecting an image from Unsplash. To do this, click the droplet icon <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tint-solid (1).svg" alt="" data-size="line"> in the upper right of the Header Style section and click the **Add Image** button. From there, select **Upload image** to load your image or **Find images** to search Unsplash images and select an image for your report. After adding an image, you can adjust the opacity of the background color as desired.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to design your own header (rather than use one of the styles in the Header Style section), you can select the "No Header" option and then add one or more slices with your desired header elements (text, color, images, and/or charts).
{% endhint %}
