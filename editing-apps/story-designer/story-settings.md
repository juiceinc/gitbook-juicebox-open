# Settings & Themes

The Settings & Themes section at the top of the Design tab is where you can modify the basic settings for your app (title, description, icon), as well as the color and typography themes. Here you can also delete or duplicate an app.&#x20;

To do this, first expand the Settings & Themes section. Make changes as needed, and then click **Save**.&#x20;

## Settings

### Title

The title appears in the apps page and app header. Aim to keep this short, ideally 1-2 words.

### Description

The description appears in the apps page. Here's where you add a bit more detail about your app. Aim to keep it at a sentence or a few phrases in length.

### Icon

This is the icon that will appear on the apps page. Each app starts with a basic icon.

## Themes

### Color theme

Choose the color theme to use for your app. You can select from pre-designed color themes or create your own. The color in the circle will be the color used in charts. The three additional colors will be used automatically as the header and section backgrounds and will be available for selection as the background color for the header, sections, and slices.&#x20;

You can switch color themes at any time. If theme colors are used as backgrounds, these will be switched to the new theme colors. (If a non-theme color is used as a background, this color will not change when the theme changes.)

### Typography theme

Choose a typographic style for your app.

### Image background (future release)

In a future release, you will be able to select an image to use as the app background, instead of the color.
