# Data

You must [load data](loading-data/) before you can design your report. Data can be in a flat file (CSV, XLS, or XLSX) or in a database table (or view). You load your data by either uploading the file or, if your data is in a database, selecting the schema and table (or view) to connect to.&#x20;

The data drawer is where you set up your data. To open the data drawer, click the bar at the bottom of the editing panel. Click the bar again to close the data drawer.&#x20;

After you load data, you can view your columns in the [data preview](the-data-preview.md) and configure charts using [dimensions and measures](/broken/pages/BVOZ5UBY2Y5juPan36Cx).
