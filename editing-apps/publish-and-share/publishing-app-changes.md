# Publishing an app (or app changes)

The first step in sharing an app is publishing the app.&#x20;

## Publishing for the first time

To publish for the first time, click the Sharing button in the app header. It will say "**Start Sharing**".

![Click Start Sharing to share an app for the first time](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (326).png>)

Next, decide whether you want to publish the app **publicly** or **privately**.

* A **public app** can be viewed by anyone with the app url. Viewers of public apps are not required to sign in and their app access cannot be managed.&#x20;
* A **private app** can be viewed only by those that have signed in with a Juicebox account that has access to the app. Viewer access to the app can be [managed in the People view](../../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md).

![Select whether to publish as a public or private app](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (330).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If your app contains information that not everyone should see, you should publish it as a private app. If your app does not contain sensitive information, you may not know whether you want the app to be public or private. That's ok! Just select one and change it later as needed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After publishing, you are ready to [invite viewers to your app](sharing-and-access-controls.md).&#x20;

## Publishing changes to an app

Until you publish them, any changes you make to an app are only visible to editors while in the draft app. That is, viewers with access to the app won't see your changes until you publish them. With Juicebox, you can publish, refine your app, publish the new changes, refine some more, publish the new changes, and so on. You can continually improve and experiment without affecting what viewers see until you're ready.

To publish changes, click the Sharing button in the app header. It will say "**Share changes**".

![Click "Share changes" to publish changes to a previously shared app](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (393).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Edit freely** - you can always [discard changes](publishing-app-changes.md#discard-changes-to-an-app), to return to the last version of the app that you shared with viewers.
{% endhint %}

The version of the app that editors work on is called the **draft app**. All changes are saved to the draft app until they are published, you do not have to keep track of whether you are working in the draft app. Here are indicators that you are in the draft version:

* You see "draft" in the app url
* You see the editing panel
* You see the Sharing button

## Discarding changes to an app

At some point you may want to discard all the unpublished changes in the draft app and go back to the previously published version of the app. To do this, click the Sharing button and select **Discard changes**.&#x20;

![Click "Discard changes" to revert back to the previously published version of the app](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (305).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Discarding changes will discard **all changes** made since the last publish _**including changes to data**_**.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}
