# Reports Navigation

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is not available on all plans.
{% endhint %}

The Reports Navigation slice displays each report the viewer has access to as a card. The viewer can select a card to navigate to that report. Here's an example of a Reports Navigation chart.
