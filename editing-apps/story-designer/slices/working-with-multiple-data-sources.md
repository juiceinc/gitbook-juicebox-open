# Multiple data tables

Each slice is limited to ingredients from a single data table. But you can use multiple data tables within the same story.

If you do use multiple data tables within a story, please note that **filtering between slices using different data tables will only work for non-advanced ingredients that are defined using fields having the same name and having values that are the same between the data tables**.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In the future, Juicebox will support more extensive filtering across slices with different data tables.
{% endhint %}
