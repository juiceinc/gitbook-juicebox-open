# Navigating Reports

For workspaces with multiple reports, users can navigate between reports from the workspace home page.

### Using the home page

After [signing in](signing-in.md) to your workspace, you will be on the workspace home page. Editors for the workspace will see all of the workspace reports. Viewers will only see those reports they have been given access to.

To find a specific report you can use the **Sort by** feature to order reports by last edit date, last publish date, or alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** feature to search report titles and descriptions.&#x20;

To open the draft version of a report, click the **Edit** button. To open the published version of a report, hover or click around the report title, and then click the **View Report** button. (If the report has not been shared, you'll see a "Not shared yet" message.) &#x20;

To get back to the home page from any report, click on the **Home** button in the report header.
