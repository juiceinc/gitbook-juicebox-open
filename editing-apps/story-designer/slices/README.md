# Slices

Slices are the basic building blocks of your story. Slices are added to [sections](../sections.md), and each slice can have text and/or an image or [chart](../charts/).&#x20;

## Adding and deleting slices

### Adding a slice

To add a slice to an empty section, select the **+ Add Slice** button.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (260).png>)

To add a slice to a section that has one or more slices, click the **+** where you want the new slice to appear.

### Duplicating a slice

Rather than adding a brand new slice, it may be easier to duplicate and modify an existing slice. To duplicate a slice, select the duplicate icon (![](../../../.gitbook/assets/clone-regular.svg)) in the slice you want to duplicate. The duplicated slice will appear directly below the original slice.&#x20;

### Deleting a slice

To delete a slice, select the delete icon (![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/trash-alt-regular (1).svg>)) in the slice you want to delete.&#x20;

## Slice content

Slices can contain text only, a chart or image only, or a combination of text and  a chart, or text and an image.

### Adding text

To add text to a slice, simply type in the text area. Use the text editor to style text and add emojis and links.

### Adding a chart

To add a chart to a slice, select the **Add Chart** button and select the desired [chart](../charts/) from the list.&#x20;

Charts show sample data until you choose what data your chart will show. This lets you explore what kind of story you want to tell even though you may not be sure what data you need.

You can interact with a chart while it is showing sample data.

### Adding an image

To add an image to a slice, select the **Add Image** button and either upload your own image or find an image on Unsplash.&#x20;

## Reordering slices

To reorder slices, drag and drop the slice where you want it to display. You can reorder slices within a section and move slices to different sections.

## Slice layouts

If a slice has a chart or image, there are four layout options that control how the chart or image will appear in relation to the text. To adjust the layout, hover over the chart or image configuration box, click the layout button, and select the desired layout option.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-right-solid (1).svg>)  Chart/Image on right | The slice text will display on the left, and the chart or image will display on the right.             |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-left-solid.svg)  Chart/Image on left         | The chart or image will display on the left and the slice text will display on the right.              |
| ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/arrow-up-solid.svg)  Chart/Image above text        | The chart or image will display above the slice text.                                                  |

## Slice backgrounds

By default, slices have a transparent background. To adjust the background color, hover over the slice, click the paint drop icon, and select the desired color from the color picker. If you have a specific color in mind, you can enter the hex code for that color.&#x20;
