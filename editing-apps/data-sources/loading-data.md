# Loading data

There are two steps to adding a data source: 

1. upload or connect to your data
2. add your data ingredients

This section covers the first step. \(The second step is covered [here](adding-ingredients/).\) You can upload a CSV or, in a future release, connect to a database table or view or a Google Sheet.

## Upload a CSV

To upload a CSV, navigate to the **Data** section of the editing panel and drag a CSV into the data source box or click **Upload CSV** and  select the CSV file to be uploaded.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using CSVs, it is important that your data be nice and clean. Here are some tips for [preparing your data](../design-tips/preparing-your-data.md).

## Connect to Sample Data

Juicebox also provides a selection of sample data tables if you want to start exploring before you have your own data. To load sample data, select the **Sample Data** button and choose one of the available datasets.

Choose a table to get started and select **Add Table**.
