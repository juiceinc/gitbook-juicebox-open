# Sections

Sections are groups of slices within a story. Sections allow you to control layouts and backgrounds.

## Add a section

To add a section, click the **Add Section** button. A new section named "Untitled section" will be added at the end of your story. The new section will initially be empty, waiting for you to add one or more slices.

Although not required, adding a meaningful section name can help you organize your slices around a theme. Section names also help when you want to collapse them, move them around, and easily find the section you want to work on.

## Delete a section

To delete a section, hover over the section header \(the gray area at the top of the section\) until you see the menu icon \(![](../../.gitbook/assets/ellipsis-h-solid.svg)\). Click the menu icon and then click **Delete**.

## Collapse and reorder sections

To move a section up or down, hover over the section header until you see the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/expand-arrows-alt-solid.svg) icon. Grab the icon and drag and drop the section where you want it to display.

Because sections can get quite long, reordering will be easier if you collapse your sections first. To collapse a section, simply click the section header. To expand a collapsed section, click section header again again.

## Section layouts

You can control how slices are laid out within a section. By default, the section will display slices vertically in a stack, with the first slice displaying at the top and each additional slice displaying underneath the previous slice. You can opt to change this layout to horizontal, with the first slice displaying on the left and each additional slice displaying to the right of the previous slice.

To change the section layout, hover over the section header until you see the layout icon \( ![](../../.gitbook/assets/arrows-alt-v-solid.svg) or ![](../../.gitbook/assets/arrows-alt-h-solid.svg)\). Click the layout icon and select either horizontal or stacked layouts. 

## Section background color

By default the section background color will be white. You can change this by clicking the paint drop ![](../../.gitbook/assets/tint-solid.svg) in the section header. From there, you can select one of the pre-set colors or enter the hex code for the color of your choice.

If you choose a dark background, Juicebox will invert the visualization and text colors automatically.

## Section background image \(future release\)

Instead of a background color, you can have a background image.
