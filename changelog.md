* **Multi-line trend.** Now you can show up to 5 measures in a single trend chart. Compare to a target or a moving average \(or both!\) and bring context and clarity to changes over time. And if you want dual vertical axes, you can do that too. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screen_recording_2021-07-22_at_12.43.47_pm.gif)

* **Custom subdomains**. Is your cute-and-fruity workspace subdomain a little _too_ cute for your needs? Now you can customize your subdomain in the new Settings page. \(Requires a Team plan subscription.\)

![](.gitbook/assets/add_an_image.gif)

* **Add a chart even if you don't have data.** No data? No problem! Now when you click "Add a Chart" and select a chart type, you'll see an example of that chart in your app. Even if you don't yet have all the data that chart requires, it will still display _and_ be interactive. So, now you can build your data story and _then_ go find the data that tells your story. That's one more blocker to frictionless storytelling _eliminated!_ 🥊

## May 24, 2021

But, those day of scrounging around for the right URL are gone! Now, you can just point your browser to [myjuicebox.io](https://www.myjuicebox.io) and sign in there -- you'll be ushered right to your space, just like the celeb you are. \(Oh yeah, and if you have multiple workspaces, you'll be able to pick the one you want -- all from [myjuicebox.io](https://www.myjuicebox.io).\)

![](.gitbook/assets/screen_recording_2021-04-12_at_5.12.50_pm.gif)

* **Sample data**. We've brought some interesting sample data sets to Juicebox so you can start making presentations without hunting for a clean CSV.

## February 25, 2021

Now, go create something _great_ and shout it from the mountain tops \(or from your favorite social network\)! 🏔

![Publish as a public app](.gitbook/assets/screen_recording_2021-01-15_at_6.06.57_pm.gif)

* **Better control of who can see what.** Owners and Admins have a new [People view](managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users) to see who is using your apps. Friend your friends🥰; change user roles✊; control app access🔐; unfriend your enemies😒.

## December 16, 2020

### 🎁 What's new?

* **Sign up for a workspace.** Now you \(and all your friends\) can [create your own __workspace](getting-started/new-workspace.md). Why would you want your own workspace? Perhaps you want to do some data presentation work for that non-profit you're helping out with. Or maybe you have an idea for a data reporting side-gig. Whatever data-prez itch you have, now you can create a separate workspace to put it in. _Juicebox all-the-things!_
* **Duplicate an app.** If you want to create a new app that is similar to an existing app, you can [duplicate it]().

### 🎁 What's new?

* **Editable section names** - Now you can rename your old, confusing [section](editing-apps/story-designer/sections.md#add-a-section) names, like _group\_a8fwcyke,_ to something less confusing like _Rumpelstiltskin_. Or something. This will make them memorable _and_ useful. And don't forget you can collapse and organize your sections to bring more clarity to your data story.

![](.gitbook/assets/jb-feature-sections2.gif)

* **Support for database connections** - Do you want to add a [data source](editing-apps/data-sources/loading-data.md) from a Redshift or Snowflake database? That's now possible! To get started, send us a message by clicking the chat button below.

### 🐛 Bug fixes & other improvements

* **Ingredients are easier to find** - In the ingredient pill, measures now show their aggregation, and advanced ingredients get a cute, new calculator icon. Less sleuthing, more finding. 🔎
* **Trend labeling cleaned up** - The x-axis has been improved so that it shows appropriate labels based on the length of time and aggregation. 📈
* Various Story Designer improvements. After all who doesn't like a better story?
* Various performance and bug fixes. A variety of faster, and an anti-variety of broke.

## October 10, 2020

### 🎁 What's new?

* **Automagic color contrast** - Don't be afraid of the dark! **🎃**Now, when you change the background of your slices to a dark color, the slice will automatically invert other colors so that it remains readable. It's a beautiful way to draw attention to the highlights of your data story! 

![Color your story with beautiful Sections.](.gitbook/assets/feature-inverting.gif)

* **Easier to find your way home** 🏠 ****- To get back to the apps page, just click the Apps button in the header of any app. It's a little like Little Red Riding Hood... but without the wolf.

### 🐛 Bug fixes & other improvements

* **Faster loading apps**: Apps built with uploaded CSVs now get faster the more you use them thanks to the magic of enhanced caching. Nobody likes waiting. Now there's less of it.
* **Better labels**: Ok, we know that in some situations, labeling in the [scatterplot chart](editing-apps/story-designer/charts/scatterplot.md) was well... broken. 🤕It's better now. Boo-boo all gone. 
* **Bar charts use bucket order:** [Bar charts](editing-apps/story-designer/charts/bar.md) that use [bucketed dimensions](editing-apps/data-sources/advanced-ingredients/bucketed-dimensions.md) will now show the buckets in the order you defined them. After all, can't we all use a little more order?  
* **Map charts zoom out farther**: The [map chart](editing-apps/story-designer/charts/map.md) now lets you zoom out farther to get a global perspective. 🌍Next step: Mars. Maybe
* Various performance and bug fixes. Much perform. Un-bugged.

## September 17, 2020

### 🎁 What's new?

* **An improved trend chart** 📈 - We did a brain upgrade on the trend chart. The [trend chart](editing-apps/story-designer/charts/trend.md) is now smarter about handling dates and times. You can easily roll up dates by month or year \(see time ingredient improvement below\), see which dates are missing data, and select ranges of dates to filter the story below. Hey, Trend Chart: it's time you were schooled 🎓. 

![](.gitbook/assets/release-trend.gif)

* **Broken ingredients** 🐣- Change is hard, we know that. When you replace a CSV on a data source, sometimes the new data has different names or different data types. This can break data ingredients. You'll see these [broken ingredients](editing-apps/data-sources/edit-a-data-source.md#fixing-broken-ingredients-caused-by-changes-in-column-names) highlighted \(in a style we call "the blushing zebra"\) so you can fix them. Now change isn't so hard. 

### 🐛 Bug fixes & other improvements

* **Roll up time ingredients by month or year**: You can easily roll up time ingredient dates by month or year by choosing a month or year format when [defining the time ingredient](editing-apps/data-sources/adding-ingredients/#time-ingredient). It's time to roll ⏰.
* **New advanced ingredient functions:** There are new options for advanced aggregations. You can calculate [percentiles and ages](editing-apps/data-sources/advanced-ingredients/advanced-formulas.md#aggregation-functions). This improvement is in the top percentile.
* **More docs on formatting:** The advanced ingredients docs now contains lots of examples of how to build [custom number formats](editing-apps/data-sources/advanced-ingredients/advanced-formats.md#advanced-number-formats). `,.0f" days until Christmas"` might not mean anything to you, but it does to Juicebox. And to Santa. 🎁
* Various performance and bug fixes.

* **Story designer slice card improvements** - Added emphasis to the "Save" button, added nice hovering touches, and cleaned some dusty corners.
* **No more "null island" ☠️🏝** - The map chart no longer displays Place dimension values where the latitude or longitude are missing \(null\) or are exactly 0,0 \(the location of what we affectionately call null island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We're guessing that's not the location you really wanted 💀\).
* **Table slice column headers now resize** - The table chart no longer cuts off multi-line column headers. Instead, the column header will resize to fit. Nobody likes being squeezed into something that's too small.
* Various performance and bug fixes.

## August 6, 2020

### 🎁What's New?
