# Design

The **Design** section of the editing panel is where you design your data story. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. Each slice can have text and/or an image or chart.&#x20;

Select the **Design** tab at the top of the editing panel to get started

There are several components you will be working with in the Design section. They are:

* Settings & Theme

These components are described on the following pages:
