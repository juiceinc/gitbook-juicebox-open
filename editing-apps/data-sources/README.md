You must [load data](loading-data.md) before you can design your story. Data can be in a flat file (CSV, XLS, or XLSX) or in a database table. You load your data by either uploading the file or, if your data is in a database, selecting the schema and table to connect to.&#x20;

After you load data, you can view your columns in the [data preview](the-data-preview.md) and create charts using [columns and column measures](columns-and-measures.md) from the [Design](../story-designer/) tab.
