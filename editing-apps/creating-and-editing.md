# Creating and Editing Reports

If you're logged in as [an editor (or a user with editing rights)](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#user-roles), you're able to create and edit reports.

## Add a new report

To add a new report, select **+ Create New** from the home page. After selecting **+ Create New**, you'll be asked to select the starting point for building your report. You can start with a pre-designed report from the **Charts**, **Examples**, or **Templates** categories, or select **Start Blank** to build an report from scratch:

* **Charts**. Selections in the Charts category are reports with one or two charts focused on a particular chart type. This is a great place to start if you know you want a particular chart type in your report, but aren't sure about what other charts or text you might want to add. The charts are placeholder charts. Just load your data and configure the placeholder charts to quickly create a complete report.&#x20;
* **Examples**. Selections in the Examples category are finished reports, with data loaded and charts configured using that data. Examples are great to add to your workspace and use as reference or inspiration.&#x20;
* **Templates**. Selections in the Templates category are fully styled reports using combinations of charts best suited for a particular task. The available templates are: Dashboard, Report, Presentation, Survey, and Infographic. The charts are placeholder charts. Just load your data and configure the placeholder charts to quickly create a complete report.&#x20;
* **Start Blank**. Select **Start Blank** if you want to start with a blank slate.&#x20;

After selecting your starting point, the report creation wizard will walk you through creating your report. You'll provide a title, description, color theme, and font, and then select **Create Report** to create your report. (Alternatively, you can select **Skip Setup** to create your report with default settings, which can be changed later.)&#x20;

Once your report is created, you'll be taken to the draft version of the report. You're now ready to edit the report to [add your data table](data-sources/) and [design your story](story-designer/). ****&#x20;

## Edit a report

You make changes to a draft version of the report (the **draft report**) using an in-browser interface called the **editing panel**. Only [users with editing rights](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#user-roles) can access the editing panel.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While changes made in the editing panel are immediately reflected in the draft report, viewers cannot see the changes until they are [shared](publish-and-share/).
{% endhint %}

### Accessing the editing panel

To access the editing panel from the home page, select **Edit** on the report.&#x20;

To access the editing panel from a published report, hit your **Esc** key.&#x20;

### Overview of a draft report

Changes to a report are made to a draft version of the report. If you see the editing panel, you know you are in the draft report. The editing panel is located on the left side of the draft report. Changes made and saved in the editing panel are immediately reflected in the draft report. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes made in the editing panel are immediately reflected in the draft report, but viewers cannot see the changes until they are [shared](publish-and-share/). Learn more about [how to manage report changes](publish-and-share/publishing-app-changes.md#making-changes-to-an-app).
{% endhint %}

You [design](story-designer/) your report using the editing panel. You add [data](data-sources/) to your report from the Data Tables drawer. You [share](publish-and-share/) your report by clicking the Sharing button.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="data-sources/" %}
[data-sources](data-sources/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="story-designer/" %}
[story-designer](story-designer/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="publish-and-share/" %}
[publish-and-share](publish-and-share/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Duplicate a report

To duplicate a report, click the **Duplicate Report** button at the top of the editing panel. Next, give your new report a title and select **Duplicate**. Once the new report is created it will open as a draft version, ready for you to edit and share.
