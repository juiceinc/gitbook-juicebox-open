# Design

The editing panel appears on the left of the draft report and is where you design the report.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (568).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The editing panel is on the left of the draft report</p></figcaption></figure>

These are the editing panel components:

* [Header buttons](./#header-buttons)
* [Settings & Themes](./#settings-and-themes)
* [Header Style](./#header-style)
* [Section](./#sections)
* [Slices](./#slices)

## Header buttons

At the top of the editing panel are two buttons: **Add Editor** and **Duplicate Report**.

The **Add Editor** button allows you to[ add editors](../../managing-users/adding-users.md#adding-editors-to-your-workspace) to the workspace.&#x20;

The **Duplicate Report** button creates a duplicate version of the report.&#x20;

## Settings & Themes

The Settings & Themes section is where you modify the basic settings for your report (title, description, icon) and the color and font themes. Here you also can delete a report and turn off the default behavior that automatically loads design changes to the draft report. Just expand the Settings & Themes section and make changes as needed.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (579).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Settings &#x26; Themes section</p></figcaption></figure>

**Delete Report**. Click this button to delete the report. &#x20;

**Icon**. The icon appears on the home page and report header. Each report starts with a basic icon.

**Title**. The title appears on the home page and report header. Aim to keep this short, ideally 1-3 words.

**Description**. The description appears on the home page and report header. Here's where you add a bit more detail about your report. Aim to keep it at a sentence or a few phrases in length.

**Color theme**. Choose the color theme to use for your report. You can select from pre-designed color themes or customize your own. The color in the circle will be the color used in charts. The three additional colors will be used automatically as the header and section backgrounds and will be available for selection as the background color for the header, sections, and slices.&#x20;

You can switch color themes at any time. If theme colors are used as backgrounds, these will be switched to the new theme colors. (If a non-theme color is used as a background, this color will not change when the theme changes.)

**Font theme**. Choose a font theme for your report. You can switch font themes at any time.

**Editor controls**. By default, changes made to the report design in the editing panel will be automatically loaded to the draft report. You can turn off that behavior by toggling off **Editor controls**. If Editor controls is turned off, you will have to click Reload Changes in the draft app before the changes will be loaded.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes to settings and themes must be shared before they will appear on the home page.
{% endhint %}

## Header Style

The Header Style section is where you create and style a basic header for your report. To do this, expand the  Header Style section, select a header style, and adjust the header background as needed.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (580).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Header Style section</p></figcaption></figure>

Click the paint drop icon in the upper right of the Header Style section to adjust the header background color or image.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (581).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click the paint drop to change the Header Background </p></figcaption></figure>

* **Customize**. The **Customize** button will allow you to define or modify a custom color theme. Any other section or slice using the original theme colors will change to the new colors.&#x20;
* **Custom**. The **Custom** button lets you add a color outside of the color theme. Using the custom color will not affect any section or slice using a theme color.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to create a more custom header, you can set the Header Style to "No Header" and use the [Headline slice](../../building-reports/story-designer/slices/charts/headline.md) to design the custom header.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Sections

Sections are groups of slices within a report. Sections allow you to control layouts and backgrounds. To add a section, click on the plus-sign button that appears when you hover above, below, or between existing sections and select the type of chart to add to the new section. (If you're not sure which chart type, pick any of them. You can always delete it later.)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (582).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click on the plus-sign button to add a new section</p></figcaption></figure>

**Rename the section**. The new section will have a name. Click on the name to edit it.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (585).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Change the section name</p></figcaption></figure>

**Hide the section**. When you hover on the section name, you'll see a toggle. If toggled off, the section will not display in the report.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (586).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Toggle off to hide the section</p></figcaption></figure>

**Delete the section**. To delete a section, click on the gear icon and select **Delete Section**.&#x20;

**Adjust the section layout**. By default slices within a section will be stacked, one on top of the next, with no space in between. This default layout can be adjusted by clicking the **Section Style** dropdown.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (587).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There are commonly used layouts available in the Layout dropdown, as well as the option to define a **Custom layout**. Custom layouts allow you to place slices exactly where you want.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (588).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Custom layout option lets you place slices exactly where you want</p></figcaption></figure>

**Adjust the section background**. You can adjust the section background color and/or image by clicking the paint drop icon and making changes as needed.&#x20;

* **Customize**. The **Customize** button will allow you to define or modify a custom color theme. Any other section or slice using the original theme colors will change to the new colors.&#x20;
* **Custom**. The **Custom** button lets you add a color outside of the color theme. Using the custom color will not affect any section or slice using a theme color.&#x20;

If you choose a dark background, Juicebox will invert the visualization and text colors automatically.

**Collapse and reorder sections**. To move a section up or down, hover over the section header and drag and drop the section where you want it to display. Because sections can get quite long, reordering will be easier if you collapse your sections first. To collapse a section, simply click the section header. To expand a collapsed section, click section header again.

## Slices

Slices are the basic building blocks of your report. There's a lot to say about them on the next page.&#x20;
