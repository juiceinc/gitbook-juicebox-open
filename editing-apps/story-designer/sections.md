# Sections

Sections are groups of slices within a story. Sections allow you to control layouts and backgrounds.

## Add a section

To add a section, click the **+ Add** button at the top or bottom of your story and then select the slice type for the first slice in the section. A new section named "Untitled Section" will be added with the initial slice.&#x20;

Although not required, adding a meaningful section name can help you organize your slices around a theme. Section names also help when you want to collapse them, move them around, and easily find the section you want to work on.&#x20;

## Delete a section

To delete a section, hover over the section header (the gray area at the top of the section) until you see the trash can icon (<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/trash-alt-regular.svg" alt="" data-size="line">). Click the icon to delete the section.

## Collapse and reorder sections

To move a section up or down, hover over the section header and drag and drop the section where you want it to display. Because sections can get quite long, reordering will be easier if you collapse your sections first. To collapse a section, simply click the section header. To expand a collapsed section, click section header again again.

## Section layouts

You can control how slices are laid out within a section. By default, the section will display slices vertically in a stack, with the first slice displaying at the top and each additional slice displaying underneath the previous slice. You can opt to change this layout to horizontal, with the first slice displaying on the left and each additional slice displaying to the right of the previous slice.&#x20;

To change the section layout, hover over the section header until you see the layout icon ( <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/arrows-alt-v-solid.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> or <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/arrows-alt-h-solid.svg" alt="" data-size="line">). Click the layout icon and select either horizontal or stacked layouts.&#x20;

## Section background color

You can change the section background color by clicking the paint drop <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tint-solid.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> in the section header. From there, you can select one of theme colors. If you have a specific color in mind, you can enter the hex code for that color after clicking the **Custom** button.&#x20;

If you choose a dark background, Juicebox will invert the visualization and text colors automatically.

## Section background image

You can add a background image to your section by either uploading your own image or by selecting an image from Unsplash. To do this, click the paint <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/tint-solid (1).svg" alt="" data-size="line"> in the upper right of the section and click the **Add Image** button. From there, select **Upload image** to load your image or **Find images** to search Unsplash images and select an image for your report. After adding an image, you can adjust the opacity of the background color as desired.&#x20;
