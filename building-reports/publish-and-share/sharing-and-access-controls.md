# Inviting viewers

After you publish your report, it's time to invite others to view it! How this happens depends on how you are controlling access to the report.

## Sharing a report with "Anyone with the link" access

To share a report with "Anyone with the link" access, copy the report link and share it with others as you would any other website link. Anyone who clicks on the link will see the published version of your report.&#x20;

## Embedding a report with "Anyone with the link" access

Reports with "Anyone with the link" access can be embedded in your site using an iframe. To do this, click the Copy Embed Code button and paste the embed code into your website:

* In **Squarespace** you'll want to add a [code block](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543167).
* **Wordpress** lets you embed media from other sites as explained in this [article](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-iframe/).
* Guidance for embedding on **Wix** is [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-using-iframes-to-display-visible-content-on-your-site).

## Sharing a report with "Link with a password" access

To share a report with "Link with a password" access, copy the report invite and share it with others. Anyone who clicks the link in the invite and enters the password will gain access to the published version of your report.&#x20;

## Sharing a report with "Sign in required" access

To share a report with "Sign in required" access, you invite individuals to sign up using a viewer access link. You can do this by:

* sending a preset email with a one-time use viewer access link to specific email addresses, or
* copying the multi-use viewer access link and sharing however you like (e.g., email, text, social media)

### Send a preset email with the viewer access link

To send a preset email with the viewer access link to one or more email addresses, select the **Send an email** option.

![Select the "Send and email" option to send the viewer access link via a preset email](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (476).png>)

Next, enter the email addresses for the recipients and click Send. The user will receive an email that looks like this:&#x20;

When the recipient clicks the **Open Report** button, they will be asked to [sign in](../../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to your Juicebox workspace to see the app.

### Copy and share a multi-use viewer access link

To share a multi-use viewer access link, select the Share a multi-use invite option.

From there, select **Copy Invite** button and send the invitation however you like (e.g., email, text, social media). When a recipient clicks the viewer access link in the invitation, they will be asked to [sign in](../../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to your Juicebox workspace to see the report. The link can be used by multiple people and will remain usable until you [regenerate the link](sharing-and-access-controls.md#regenerate-link) by clicking **Renew Invite**.&#x20;

### Controlling Access

#### Regenerating a viewer access link

To prevent new users from accessing the app through a previously shared viewer link, you can regenerate the link. Any previously used links will no longer allow new users to sign up. Users that have already signed up will still be able to see the app. Their access can be managed through the [People view](../../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users).&#x20;

To regenerate the link, click the **Renew Invite** button.

You can change how access to a report is controlled at any time. Simply click the access control you want.&#x20;
