# Navigating Apps

For workspaces with multiple apps, users can navigate between apps using the apps page. In addition, users can navigate directly to a specific app using its app link.&#x20;

### Using the apps page

After [signing in](signing-in.md) to your workspace, you will be on the workspace apps page. Editors for the workspace will see all of the workspace apps on the apps page. Viewers will only see those apps they have been given access to.

To find a specific app you can use the **Sort by** feature to order apps by last edit date, last publish date, or alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** feature to search app titles and descriptions.&#x20;

To open the draft version of an app, click the **Edit** button. To open the published version of an app, hover or click around the app title, and then click the **Open Published** button. (If the app has not been published, you'll see a "Not published yet" message. &#x20;

### Using the app link

Each app has a unique link that will take a user directly to the app. App links look similar to `https://227-friendly-lemons.myjuicebox.io/a/movie_trends2/`.
