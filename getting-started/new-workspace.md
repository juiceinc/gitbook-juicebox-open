## Your new workspace

After creating your workspace, you'll be taken to the _Hello, Juicebox!_ app within your workspace. You are the [owner](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#owner) of this workspace.

We highly recommend that you complete the _Hello, Juicebox!_ app tour. This will walk you through how to add a chart to an app.
