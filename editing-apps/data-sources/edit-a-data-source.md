# Update or delete a data source

## Replace data

From time to time, you may want to update the data for a data source. For example, you may want to correct data in existing rows, add or remove rows, or add or remove columns. To do this, open the [data preview](loading-data.md#the-data-preview) for the data source you want to update. Select Replace and select the CSV containing the replacement data to begin the upload process. Once the upload process finishes, refresh the page. The app will then display the updated data.

{% hint style="success" %}
It is good practice to publish before replacing data. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Replace functionality only updates the data underlying the data source. It does not update the name of the data source or the data ingredient definitions. 
{% endhint %}

### Fixing "broken ingredients"

So long as the column names in the new CSV are the same as in the old CSV, no further changes are needed. But if the column names have changed, you will need to point any affected ingredients to the new fields.  For example, suppose you have a `Student Name` dimension ingredient that points to the `student_name` field. Later, you replace the original data with a CSV that has column `studentname`, instead of `student_name`. Your app will display a "Couldn't get the data" message for any slices that use the `Student Name` ingredient because that ingredient is pointing to a field that no longer exists in the data. This is called a **broken ingredient**. To fix the ingredient, click on the `Student Name` ingredient pill and select the updated field name `studentname` from the dropdown. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you see the "Couldn't get the data" error message in your app, this means there is one or more broken ingredients being used in your app. To locate the broken ingredients, go to the slice in the Designer section of the editing panel where you first see "Couldn't get the data" instead of the expected chart. This is the slice that has the first broken ingredient. In many cases, the broken ingredients will display with red highlighting and stripes. After identifying and fixing the broken ingredient, reload the page. Continue this process \(finding the slice with the first "Couldn't get the data" message, identifying the broken ingredient, and fixing the broken ingredient\), until the entire app loads without error.

## Update ingredient definitions

To make a change to an ingredient definition, click on the ingredient pill in either the Data Sources or Story Designer sections of the editing panel. This will open up the ingredient editor.  From there, make the desired changes to the ingredient. Keep in mind that some changes may require that you [add an advanced ingredient](advanced-ingredients/).

## Delete a data source

If you have a data source that you don't plan to use in your app, you may want to delete the data source to declutter the Data Sources section of the app editor. To do this, open the [data preview](loading-data.md#the-data-preview) for the data source you want to delete and select the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/trash-alt-regular.svg) button, then select **Yes, delete it**. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will receive a warning message if the data source ingredients are used in your app. In general, you should not delete a data source that is being used by an app. Doing so will cause all ingredients from the data source to break, i.e., become "broken ingredients."

{% hint style="warning" %}
At this time, you cannot delete a data source if any ingredient from the data source is being used in your story.
