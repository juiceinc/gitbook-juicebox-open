# Inviting viewers

After you publish your app, it's time to invite others to view it! How this happens depends on whether you published the app publicly or privately.

## Sharing a public app

To share a public app, click the Sharing button and then click the **Share Public Link** button to copy the app link. Share the copied link with others as you would any other website link. Anyone who clicks on the link will see the published version of your app.&#x20;

## Embedding a public app

Public apps can be embedded in your site using an iframe. To do this click the Copy Embed Code button and paste the embed code into your website:

* In **Squarespace** you'll want to add a [code block](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543167).
* **Wordpress** lets you embed media from other sites as explained in this [article](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-iframe/).
* Guidance for embedding on **Wix** is [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-using-iframes-to-display-visible-content-on-your-site).

## Sharing a private app

To share a private app, you invite individuals to sign up using a viewer access link. You can do this by:

* sending a preset email with the viewer access link to specific email addresses, or
* copying the viewer access link and sharing however you like (e.g., email, text, social media)

### Send a preset email with the viewer access link

To send a preset email with the viewer access link to one or more email addresses, click the Sharing button and select the **Send Viewer Access** button.

Next, enter the email addresses for the recipients and click Send.

The user will receive an email that looks like this:&#x20;

When the recipient clicks the **Open Invite** button, they will be asked to [sign in](../../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to your Juicebox workspace to see the app.

### Copy and share a viewer access link

To copy the viewer access link, click the Sharing button and then click the **Share Viewer Link** button. From there, paste and share the viewer access link however you like (e.g., email, text, social media). When a recipient clicks the viewer access link, they will be asked to [sign in](../../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) to your Juicebox workspace to see the app. The link can be used by multiple people and will remain usable until you [regenerate the link](sharing-and-access-controls.md#regenerate-link).&#x20;

### Controlling Access

#### Regenerating a viewer access link

To prevent new users from accessing the app through a previously shared viewer link, you can regenerate the link. Any previously used links will no longer allow new users to sign up. Users that have already signed up will still be able to see the app. Their access can be managed through the [People view](../../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users).&#x20;

To regenerate the link, select **Link Settings** and then **Regenerate**.&#x20;

#### User email domain (future release)

In a future release, links will be able to limit access to only users with specific email domains.&#x20;

## Switching between public and private sharing

To change a public app to a private app, or vice versa, simply click the Sharing button and select Public or Private.&#x20;
