# Adding Users

## Adding viewers to an app

To add a viewer to a private app, simply [share the app access link](../editing-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md#access-links).  Anyone who clicks on the access link and [signs in](../viewing-apps/signing-in.md) becomes a new user in your workspace with the [viewer user role](user-management-and-roles.md#viewer) and access to the app.  

{% hint style="info" %}
For public apps, [anyone with the app link can view the app ](../editing-apps/publish-and-share/sharing-and-access-controls.md#sharing-a-public-app)\(no sign in required\). 
{% endhint %}

## Adding editors to your workspace

You can add an editor to your workspace from either the [People view](user-management-and-roles.md#managing-users) or from the Publish & Share section of any app. From there, click the **+ New Editor** button.

![From the Publish &amp; Share section, click + New Editor to invite a new editor to your workspace ](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28225%29.png)

Next, select whether to invite the new editor by creating and sharing an invite link or by sending an invitation via email.

### Invite by link

To invite a new editor by invite link, select **Create Invite Link**. Then copy the invite link and share with the person you want to invite as an editor. Because the invite link will only work once, you should only share the link with one person. Upon clicking the link, the person will be asked to create a Juicebox account if one does not already exist and sign in. After signing in, the person will be an [editor](user-management-and-roles.md#editor) in your workspace.

### Invite by email

To invite a new editor by email, select **Invite via email**. Then enter the email addresses for each person you want to invite as an editor and click **Send**. Each person will receive an email with a one-time use link. Upon clicking the link, the person will be asked to create a Juicebox account if one does not already exist and sign in. After signing in, the person will be an [editor](user-management-and-roles.md#editor) in your workspace.
