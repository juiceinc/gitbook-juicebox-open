# Multiple data sources

 Each slice is limited to ingredients from a single data source. But slices within a story do not have to use the same data source. 

If you do use multiple data sources within a story, please note that **filtering between slices using different data sources will only work for non-advanced ingredients that are defined using fields having the same name and having values that are the same between the data sources**. This can lead to unexpected results. 

{% hint style="info" %}
In the future, Juicebox will support more extensive filtering across slices with different data sources.
{% endhint %}
