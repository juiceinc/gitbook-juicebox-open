# An example app

Throughout this documentation, we will consider the needs of HealthyCo \(a fake customer\). HealthyCo is a healthcare company that promotes health. HealthyCo needs an app that will pinpoint where in the US customers most need its health-promoting products. 

Using Juicebox, HealthyCo built the [Unhealthy Americans](http://healthyco.juiceboxdata.com/a/unhealthy_americans/) app using [this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3buqwkK6JGWL7LxX-EcNDycCdxnYxYxLD9d_d2CDmI/edit?usp=sharing) from the [CDC](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7). We'll use the Unhealthy Americans app to demonstrate how to build an app using the Juicebox platform.
