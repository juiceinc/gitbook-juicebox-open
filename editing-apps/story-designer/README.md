# Designer

The Designer section of the editing panel is where you design your data story. A story should be tightly focused on a particular audience and purpose and gently guide users to the actionable insights they need. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. Each slice can have text and/or charts. 

To access the Designer section, select the **Designer** tab at the top of the editing panel.
