# Design

The editing panel is where you design your data story. Within each story are sections, and within each section are slices. Each slice can have text and/or an image or chart.&#x20;

There are several components you will be working with in the editing panel. They are:

* Settings & Theme
* Header Style
* Sections
* Slices
* Charts

These components are described on the following pages:

{% content-ref url="story-settings.md" %}
[story-settings.md](story-settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="sections.md" %}
[sections.md](sections.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="slices/" %}
[slices](slices/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="charts/" %}
[charts](charts/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
