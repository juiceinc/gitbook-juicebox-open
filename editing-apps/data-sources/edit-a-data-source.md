# Managing data

## Replace data

From time to time, you may want to update your data. For example, you may want to correct data in existing rows, add or remove rows, or add or remove columns.&#x20;

To do this, either drag the new data file (CSV, XLS, or XLSX) onto the data you want to replace or click the **Replace file** button and select the new data file.

Once the upload process finishes, refresh the page. The app will then display the updated data.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
It is good practice to share before replacing data. That way if you select the wrong CSV (or something else goes wrong), you can revert back to where things were before doing the replace.
{% endhint %}

## Update columns or measures

To make a change to a column or measure, click on its orange pill in either the Data or Design sections of the editing panel. This will open up the column or measure editor. From there, make the desired changes. Keep in mind that some changes may require that you [add an advanced column or measure](advanced-ingredients/).

## Delete data

If you have data that you don't plan to use in your app, you may want to delete the data to declutter the Data section of the editing panel. To do this, open the [data preview](loading-data.md#the-data-preview) for the data you want to delete and select the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/trash-alt-regular.svg) button, then select **Yes, delete it**.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will receive a warning message if the data source ingredients are used in your app.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
