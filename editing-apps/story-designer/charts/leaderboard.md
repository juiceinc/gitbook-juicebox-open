# Leaderboard

The leaderboard chart displays which dimensions rank at the top \(or bottom\) across multiple measures. Adding a slice with a leaderboard chart \(i.e., a leaderboard slice\) is a good choice when users want to quickly see the "winners" and "losers."

## Adding a leaderboard slice

To add a leaderboard slice:

* select **Leaderboard** from the chart list
* select the dimension you want to be ranked
* select the measures by which you want to rank the dimension
* select the max rows
* \(optional\) add a title

## Using a leaderboard slice

If you have 10 rows in your leaderboard, you can use the **LOOK AT** options to see the top 10, bottom 10, or top 5 and bottom 5. \(If you have 25 rows, you can opt to see the top 25, bottom 25, or top 13 and bottom 12\). To see the ranking of a dimension value not shown in the leaderboard, you can click the filter pill and search for the dimension. Selections made in the leaderboard slice will filter downstream slices.
