# Useful resources

Here are some resources that we use at Juice and recommend.

## Colors and images

Here are some tools we like for finding the right colors and images for your report:

* [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka?hl=en): a Google Chrome extension that lets you find the hex code for any color on most websites.
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/): a color scheme generator that helps you find colors that work well together.
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): a source for freely-usable images, with photographer attribution.

## Fake data generator

Sometimes you want to play around with design before gathering real data. To do that, you'll need some fake data. [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) can help generate good quality fake data quickly. We've also had success asking GenAI tools like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) to create fake data.&#x20;

## Data preparation

Cleaning and restructuring data is a lot easier with a tool like [Alteryx Designer Cloud](https://www.alteryx.com/products/designer-cloud).&#x20;
