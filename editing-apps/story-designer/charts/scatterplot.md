# Scatterplot

The scatterplot chart displays a dimension as a bubble plotted at the intersection of the x-axis measure and the y-axis measure. Adding a slice with a scatterplot chart \(i.e., a scatterplot slice\) is a good choice when users want to see the relationship between two measures.  

## Adding a scatterplot slice

To add a scatterplot slice:

* select **Scatterplot** from the chart list

## Using a scatterplot slice

Selections made in the scatterplot slice will filter downstream slices. You can select individual bubbles or regions. Selecting a region will select all bubbles within the region.
