# Creating and Editing Apps

If you're logged in as [an editor (or a user with editing rights)](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#user-roles), you're able to create and edit apps.

## Add a new app

To add a new app, select **+ Create New** from the apps page. After selecting **+ Create New**, you'll be asked to select the starting point for building your app. You can start with a pre-designed app from the **Templates**, **Charts**, or **Examples** categories, or select **Start Blank** to build an app from scratch:

* **Templates**. Selections in the Templates category are fully styled apps using combinations of charts best suited for a particular task. The available templates are: Dashboard, Report, Presentation, Survey, and Infographic. The charts are placeholder charts. Just load your data and configure the placeholder charts to quickly create a complete app.&#x20;
* **Charts**. Selections in the Charts are apps with one or two charts focused on a particular chart type. This is a great place to start if you know you want a particular chart type in your app, but aren't sure about what other charts or text you might want to add. The charts are placeholder charts. Just load your data and configure the placeholder charts to quickly create a complete app.&#x20;
* **Examples**. Selections in the Examples category are finished apps, with data loaded and charts configured using that data. Examples are great to add to your workspace and use as reference or inspiration.&#x20;
* **Start Blank**. Select **Start Blank** if you want to start with a blank slate.&#x20;

After selecting your starting point, the app creation wizard will walk you through creating your app. You'll provide a title, description, color theme, and font, and then select **Create App** to create your app. (Alternatively, you can select **Skip Setup** to create your app with default settings, which can be changed later.)&#x20;

Once your app is created, you'll be taken to the draft version of the app. You're now ready to edit the app to [add your data source](data-sources/) and [design your story](story-designer/). ****&#x20;

## Edit an app

You make changes to a draft version of the app (the **draft app**) using an in-browser interface called the **editing panel**. Only [users with editing rights](../managing-users/user-management-and-roles.md#user-roles) can access the editing panel.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While changes made in the editing panel are immediately reflected in the draft app, viewers cannot see the changes until they are [shared](publish-and-share/).
{% endhint %}

### Accessing the editing panel

To access the editing panel from the apps page, select **Edit** on the app.&#x20;

To access the editing panel from a published app, select **Edit this app** from the profile menu in the app header or hit your **Esc** key.&#x20;

### Overview of a draft app

Changes to an app are made to a draft version of the app. If you see the editing panel, you know you are in the draft app. The editing panel is located on the left side of the draft app. Changes made and saved in the editing panel are immediately reflected in the draft app. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes made in the editing panel are immediately reflected in the draft app, but viewers cannot see the changes until they are [shared](publish-and-share/). Learn more about [how to manage app changes](publish-and-share/publishing-app-changes.md#making-changes-to-an-app).
{% endhint %}

![Parts of a draft app](<../.gitbook/assets/image (220).png>)

There are three editing panel sections: [Data](data-sources/), [Design](story-designer/), and [Share](publish-and-share/). These sections are accessed from the buttons at the top of the editing panel and are described on the following pages:

{% content-ref url="data-sources/" %}
[data-sources](data-sources/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="story-designer/" %}
[story-designer](story-designer/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="publish-and-share/" %}
[publish-and-share](publish-and-share/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Delete an app

[Deleting an app](story-designer/story-settings.md#deleting-an-app) is done from **Design** section, under **Settings & Themes**.&#x20;
