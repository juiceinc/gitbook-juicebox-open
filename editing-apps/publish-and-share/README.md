# Share

Until your report is shared, only editors in your workspace will see the changes you've made. When you're ready for others to see your report, it's time to share your work with viewers. There are two steps to sharing a report:

1. Publish the report (or changes to the report)
2. Invite viewers

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also share a report by downloading it as a PNG or PDF file and sending to viewers as an attachment. To download the app, click the **Download** button in the header or header bar of either the draft or published version of the report.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;The following pages describe these steps:

{% content-ref url="publishing-app-changes.md" %}
[publishing-app-changes.md](publishing-app-changes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="sharing-and-access-controls.md" %}
[sharing-and-access-controls.md](sharing-and-access-controls.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
