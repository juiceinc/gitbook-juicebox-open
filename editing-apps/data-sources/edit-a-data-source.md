# Managing data

## Replace data

From time to time, you may want to update your data. For example, you may want to correct data in existing rows, add or remove rows, or add or remove columns.&#x20;

To do this, click the **Replace file** button. If there is more than one data table in your report, select the data table that you want to update. Then, select the new data file (CSV, XLS, or XLSX).

Once the upload process finishes, refresh the page. The report will then display the updated data.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
It is good practice to share before replacing data. That way, if you select the wrong CSV (or something else goes wrong), you can revert back to where things were before doing the replace.
{% endhint %}

## Update columns or measures

To make a change to a column or measure, click on its pill in either the [data preview](the-data-preview.md) or in the chart configuration. This will open up the column or measure editor. From there, make the desired changes. Keep in mind that some changes may require that you [add an advanced column or measure](advanced-ingredients/).

## Delete data

If you have data that you don't plan to use in your report, you may want to delete the data to declutter the Data Tables drawer. To do this, open the Data Tables drawer, select the data table you want to delete, click the gear icon, and select **Delete**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will receive a warning message if the data table columns are used in your report.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you are sure you want to delete the data table, click **Yes, delete it**.

## Download data

You can download the data in a data table by opening the Data Tables drawer, selecting the data table you want to download, clicking the gear icon, and selecting **Download**. The data will download as a CSV.
