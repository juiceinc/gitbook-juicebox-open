# Multiple data tables

Each slice is limited to ingredients from a single data table. But you can use multiple data tables within the same story.

When configuring a chart in an app with multiple data tables, you will select the data table to use for the chart.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do use multiple data tables within a story, please note that **filtering between slices using different data tables will only work for non-advanced ingredients that are defined using fields having the same name and having values that are the same between the data tables**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In the future, Juicebox will support more extensive filtering across slices with different data tables.
