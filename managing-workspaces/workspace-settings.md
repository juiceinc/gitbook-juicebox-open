# Workspace Settings

You can view and modify your workspace settings by going to the Settings page. To access the Settings page, click the gear icon in the upper right corner of your workspace. From there, select **Settings**.

Once on the Settings page, you'll be able to change your workspace name and, if subscribed to a plan, create a custom subdomain and limit app access to only email addresses from a specific domain.
